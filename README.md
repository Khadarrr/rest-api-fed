This project is a RESTful API built using Next.js and Supabase. It features CRUD operations for student and artist data, with functional endpoints at https://rest-api-fed.vercel.app/artists and https://rest-api-fed.vercel.app/students. Although Drizzle was initially considered for state management, its integration remains incomplete. The API is fully operational, providing a platform for seamless interaction with student and artist API`s
